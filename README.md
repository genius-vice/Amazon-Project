CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub → Vercel)

This project uses a fully automated CI/CD pipeline powered by GitHub and Vercel.

Continuous Integration (CI):
Every time I push changes to the GitHub repository, Vercel automatically pulls the latest code and runs a fresh build. This ensures that the project is always in a working, up-to-date state and catches build issues early.

Continuous Deployment (CD):
After a successful build, Vercel automatically deploys the latest version to production. No manual deployment steps are needed — the site goes live instantly with every commit.

Automated Build & Deploy Flow:
Git Commit → GitHub → Vercel Auto-Build → Vercel Auto-Deploy → Live Website
This setup ensures fast iteration, safe updates, and reliable deployment — just like modern professional development workflows.
