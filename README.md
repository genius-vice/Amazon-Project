## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub → Vercel)

This project includes a fully automated **CI/CD pipeline** using GitHub and Vercel.

### Continuous Integration (CI)
Every push to GitHub triggers:
- Automatic build process on Vercel  
- Validation of project structure and deployment output  

### ✅ Continuous Deployment (CD)
After a successful build:
- Vercel automatically deploys the latest version  
- Changes go live instantly at the production URL  

### ✅ Deployment Pipeline Flow

Git Commit → GitHub → Vercel Auto-Build → Vercel Auto-Deploy → Live Website

This is the same CI/CD style used in modern professional environments for frontend deployment.
